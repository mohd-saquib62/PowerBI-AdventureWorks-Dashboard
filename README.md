# PowerBI-AdventureWorks-Dashboard
This Power BI project was created during my certification course to demonstrate practical skills in data modeling, analysis, and dashboard design. The dataset is based on AdventureWorks, a fictional bicycle and accessories company.

The final result is a 4-page interactive dashboard that presents key business insights in a simple yet effective format.
